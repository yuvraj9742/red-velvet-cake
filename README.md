How to Make Red Velvet Cake
I use specific ingredients, certain amounts, and unique mixing techniques to produce my best red velvet cake recipe. Begin by whisking the dry ingredients together, then beat together the wet ingredients. We’ll combine the two, add buttermilk and tint the batter red. More on food coloring below.


Cake Flour: I highly recommend cake flour. Cake flour is much lighter than all-purpose and the perfect base for a light, soft-crumbed cake texture. Like I mention above, red velvet’s texture is important to the authenticity of the flavor. You will thank me for the recommendation after you taste how incredibly soft this cake is. It’s the texture you find at professional bakeries.
Unsweetened Cocoa Powder: 2 Tablespoons is plenty for a little cocoa flavor without overpowering the vanilla and butter flavors.
Butter & Oil: What sets red velvet cake apart from chocolate is its buttery flavor. With only butter, we risk a dry cake. With only oil, we lose the butter flavor and softness that comes with creaming butter & sugar together. So all that’s to say, use both butter and oil. Moist texture, soft and cakey texture, buttery flavor.
Buttermilk: Buttermilk is tangy, creamy, and makes baked goods extremely moist. You can’t make delicious red velvet cake without it! Additionally, buttermilk helps activate the baking soda to leaven the cake.
What About the Food Coloring?
Red velvet cake wouldn’t be red without food coloring. I recommend gel food coloring because the color is concentrated, so you need less of it. For natural coloring, use beet powder. If you don’t want to use food coloring, leave it out! The cake will have the same flavor and be a lovely shade of cocoa.

My #1 Trick
I add one simple step to this red velvet cake recipe and it guarantees the BEST texture.

Whip the egg whites separately, then fold into the batter.

This cake recipe requires 4 large eggs. Separate the eggs before starting. Beat the egg yolks with the wet ingredients, then beat the egg whites into fluffy peaks and fold them in last. Beating the egg whites incorporates air and promises a velvet-rich texture.

You will never go back.

Cream Cheese Frosting
In my opinion, cream cheese frosting pairs best with red velvet’s flavor and this frosting recipe is really simple. You need block-style cream cheese, butter, confectioners’ sugar, a splash of milk, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to offset the sweetness. It glides on seamlessly and is silky smooth. If you’re looking to pipe decoration with this cream cheese frosting, chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. This guarantees the creamy frosting will hold its shape.

Description
Red velvet cake is much more than vanilla cake tinted red. This recipe produces the best red velvet cake with superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from buttermilk. My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.

Ingredients

3 cups (380g) cake flour (spoon & leveled)
1 teaspoon baking soda
2 Tablespoons (10g) unsweetened natural cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
2 cups (400g) granulated sugar
1 cup (240ml) canola or vegetable oil
4 large eggs, room temperature and separated
1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract
1 teaspoon distilled white vinegar
liquid or gel red food coloring
1 cup (240ml) buttermilk, at room temperature
Cream Cheese Frosting
16 ounces (450g) full-fat block cream cheese, softened to room temperature
3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
5 and 1/2 cups (660g) confectioners’ sugar
1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
pinch of salt, to taste
Instructions

Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.
Make the cake: Whisk the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Set aside.
Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on medium-high speed until combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the oil, egg yolks, vanilla extract, and vinegar and beat on high for 2 minutes. (Set the egg whites aside.) Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed.
With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in 2-3 additions alternating with the buttermilk. Beat in your desired amount of food coloring just until combined. I use 1-2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Vigorously whisk or beat the 4 egg whites on high speed until fluffy peaks form as pictured above, about 3 minutes. Gently fold into cake batter. The batter will be silky and slightly thick.
Divide batter between cake pans. Bake for 30-32 minutes or until the tops of the cakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If the cakes need a little longer as determined by wet crumbs on the toothpick, bake for longer. However, careful not to overbake as the cakes may dry out. Remove cakes from the oven and cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.
Make the frosting: In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and butter together on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 3 minutes until completely combined and creamy. Add more confectioners’ sugar if frosting is too thin or an extra pinch of salt if frosting is too sweet. Frosting should be soft, but not runny.
Assemble and frost: Using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. I used Wilton piping tip #12 for decoration around the top.
Refrigerate cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake hold its shape when cutting.
Cover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days. Frosted cake or unfrosted cake layers can be frozen up to 2-3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator and bring to room temperature before decorating/serving.
Notes
Make Ahead Instructions: The cake layers can be baked, cooled, and covered tightly at room temperature overnight. Likewise, the frosting can be prepared then covered and refrigerated overnight. Let the frosting sit at room temperature to slightly soften for 10 minutes before assembling and frosting.
Cake Flour: For best texture and taste, I strongly recommend cake flour. You can find it in the baking aisle and I have many more recipes using it. If you can’t get your hands on cake flour, you can make a DIY cake flour substitute.
Vinegar: The vinegar helps brighten the red color. Don’t get scared, a touch of vinegar is normal in red velvet desserts! You can’t taste it.
Why is everything at room temperature? When everything is near the same temperature, they mix together easily, evenly, and produce a uniform texture. It’s important!
Food Coloring: The amount of red food coloring is up to you. I tested with varying amounts. To get the dark red color you see here, use about 2-3 Tablespoons of liquid food coloring or 2 teaspoons gel food coloring. Dye the batter until you are pleased with the color. Use beet powder for a natural alternative or leave the food coloring out completely.
Buttermilk: Buttermilk is a key ingredient and flavor in this recipe. You can use low fat or full fat. If you don’t have buttermilk, you can make your own sour milk. To do so, add 1 and 1/2 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice or white vinegar to a liquid measuring cup. Add enough regular milk (whole milk is best) to make 1 cup. Stir the two together, then let it sit for 5 minutes before using.
Sheet Cake: This batter fits nicely into a 9×13 inch cake pan or 12×17 inch sheet pan. Same oven temperature. Bake for about 40-45 minutes or 20-25 minutes, respectively. Keep your eye on the cake and use a toothpick to test for doneness.
3 Layer Cake: Divide the batter between 3 9-inch cake pans. Bake for about 22-25 minutes.
Bundt Cake: This cake batter fits into a 10-cup or larger bundt pan. I’m unsure of the exact bake time (likely around an hour), but use a toothpick to test for doneness. Same oven temperature.
Cupcakes: You can use this cake batter for 2-3 dozen cupcakes. Fill cupcake liners 1/2 – 2/3 of the way full. Bake for 20-21 minutes or until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when gently touched and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Use my red velvet cupcakes recipe if you need fewer.

360 grams does not equal 3 cups? Do most people that make this use weights or cups ?

Kiran says:January 23, 2021 at 3:19 pm
I cup of cake flour weighs 114g, so three cups will weight 342g. Often when a recipe is tested and fine tuned, small additions may be made, hence the 360g. You may be confused because you are thinking 1 cup of something should weigh 250g, but remember that convention applies only to the universal substance aka water. 1 cup of water will weigh 250g, this conversion does not stand for all substances.

The cake mix seemed to curdle when I added the egg whites, it wasn’t silky. It appears to have baked ok but I won’t know the texture until I cut it. Any advice please?

Made exactly as directed and the cake texture was really really off. I make a red velvet cake every year for my husband’s birthday (over 20 years now), trying a new recipe each time. This one was so bad we tossed it and I made a second using a different recipe. So disappointed! Frosting was great, the cake looked fine, but the texture was awful.

Hands down the best red velvet cake I’ve ever had and I made it using this recipe! I couldn’t be more proud and delighted that it went over so well for my dad’s birthday. I followed the recipe to the T, including the tips and tricks for refrigerating the cake before serving for the best cut cake, it worked. Thank you for this recipe!

If making a sheet cake do you just grease and flour pan no parchment paper?

Hi Gary! For a sheet cake you can simply generously grease the pan, no need for parchment paper.

Hi Niamh, we recommend apple cider vinegar if you can’t find white vinegar.

Hi Sally

I just want to say that I have made the Red Velvet Cake a number of times. The first
time was a big hit. The second and third time I couldn’t seem to find the red food
coloring that gave it that beautiful color. To make a long story short I just made another
Red Velvet for my Husbands 69th Birthday and the color is amazing.
I love your receipts. My sister found the perfect food coloring it’s call RED (No- Taste)
by Wilton and its from Walmart!

Thanks for all your amazing receipts

Olá Sally !

Can I bake this as one cake in a 10″ pan ? Also, can I use ACV in place of white vinegar and can I use red velvet powder if I don’t have the gel or liquid ?

Thanks !

Trina @ Sally's Baking Addiction says:March 16, 2021 at 2:53 pm
Hi Lanaa! This will be too much batter for a one layer 10 inch cake. Instead, you can use this recipe for a thinner 2 layer 10-inch cake. Or use our Cake Pan Sizes & Conversions post to help you calculate exactly how much batter you would need for one layer. Apple cider vinegar will be fine in the place of white. A powdered food coloring should work fine – see recipe notes for details on coloring options. Hope you love this cake!

If I were to make this recipe as a Bundt cake, do you think it would be possible to stuff it with filling similar to your pumpkin cream cheese Bundt cake?

Definitely! You can use the cream cheese filling from our cheesecake swirl carrot bundt cake.

Hi Myrna, that should be fine. Just keep it in the fridge as long as possible before it’s put out to serve. An alternative frosting, if you’re interested, would be vanilla buttercream. Enjoy!
